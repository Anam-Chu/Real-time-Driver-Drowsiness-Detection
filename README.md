# Real-time-Driver-Drowsiness-Detection


#Overview

Real-time Driver Drowsiness Detection is an intelligent system designed to monitor drivers' levels of drowsiness and alert them when signs of fatigue are detected. This project utilizes computer vision techniques and deep learning algorithms to track drivers' facial landmarks and analyze eye movements in real-time.

#Features

Real-time detection of driver drowsiness using a webcam or video stream.
Alerts when the system detects signs of drowsiness, ensuring driver safety.
Tracks facial landmarks and analyzes eye closure patterns to determine drowsiness.
Customizable alert settings, including visual and audio alerts.


#Credits

The implementation of this project is inspired by various research papers and open-source projects related to computer vision and drowsiness detection.
